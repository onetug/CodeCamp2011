        <Session Id="114" Name="DNN Relaunch SEO" Track="DNN Design" StartTime="15:20:00" EndTime="16:20:00" Level="200" Room="J104" Description="As the popularity of DNN has grown, converting existing websites to the DotNetNuke platform is a common practice. In this session I would like to provide a few pointers on how to make such conversions a success in regards to organic search engine optimization (SEO.) The goal is to ensure that the switch from static HTML pages (or other CMS) to DNN does not result in any significant drop of search engine ranking for the core set of key phrases. In order to meet that goal, I will discuss best practices and techniques in regards to 301 redirects, custom 404 pages, XML sitemaps, and on-page DNN SEO." Speaker="Tom Kraak" />
        <Session Id="115" Name="Using Third Party Modules as a Framework" Track="DNN Administration" StartTime="13:00:00" EndTime="14:00:00" Level="100" Room="J104" Description="A major advantage to the DotNetNuke community is the amount of third party modules available.  These range from free add-ons to complex vendor created solutions.  When used correctly, these modules can save a ton of development time and cost.  Unfortunately businesses rarely utilize these modules correctly.  One of the main sources of projects falling off schedule (and off budget) is the concept that these modules will act as a silver bullet to all of your requirements.  This session will identify how to utilize many third party modules as a framework rather than a complete solution.  We will examine the pro's and con's of full module use, and how we can still benefit from a module that only meets 50% (or less) of our needs." Speaker="Nick Christy" />
        <Session Id="116" Name="Installation and Upgrading of DotNetNuke and DNN Modules" Track="DNN Administration" StartTime="09:40:00" EndTime="10:40:00" Level="200" Room="J104" Description="There are quite a few misconceptions out there about the level of difficulty when installing and upgrading DotNetNuke.  This session is intended to walk you through the entire installation and upgrade process, outlining some of the common problems and solutions.  As an add-on, we will also go through installing modules on DotNetNuke.  At the end of this session, you will walk out being inspired to install DotNetNuke right away, and install all of your favorite modules.  After we're done, you too will think it's easy!" Speaker="Will Strohl" />
        <Session Id="82" Name="Introduction to SQL Server Statistics" Track="SQL Server" StartTime="09:40:00" EndTime="10:40:00" Level="200" Room="J102" Description="Statistics are used by SQL Server to understand the distribution of data, which in turn helps it make a decision about which query plan to implement to get good query performance. You'll learn how stats are created and updated, how to maintain them, and how to detect when out of date or skewed statistics are affecting query performance. It's good foundational knowledge that will prove useful more often than you might expect!" Speaker="Andy Warren" />
        <Session Id="92" Name="Code Generation with T4 and Visual Studio 2010" Track="Visual Studio &amp; ALM" StartTime="08:30:00" EndTime="09:30:00" Level="300" Room="V107" Description="T4 allows you to use simple ASP.NET-like template syntax to generate application source code, configuration files, stored procedures and more. This session shows you everything you need to start building your own or customizing existing code generators, including an overview of code generation, T4 template syntax and how to create a working template for generating CRUD stored procedures from scratch." Speaker="Oleg Sych" />
        <Session Id="62" Name="Using C# as a Scripting Language" Track="Languages" StartTime="14:10:00" EndTime="15:10:00" Level="300" Room="J109" Description="Many developers are surprised to learn that C# can be used as a scripting language, despite being a strongly-typed language.  During this presentation walk through an open-source C# scripting host, and see how it can be embedded in an application to provide runtime scripting services." Speaker="Zachary Gramana" />
        <Session Id="101" Name="Introduction to ASP.NET Dynamic Data" Track="Web" StartTime="10:50:00" EndTime="11:50:00" Level="300" Room="C110A" Description="Dynamic Data is one of the best and undeservingly forgotten new features of ASP.NET 4.0. Have you looked at Dynamic Data in its initial release and decided it was too limited, too complex or could only be used for simple screens? Think again! Dynamic Data unlocks the true potential of WebForms and LINQ. It can be used in existing pages of traditional ASP.NET applications as well as new, completely dynamic web sites. This session will show you how to use this powerful framework, starting with the simple controls and templates that make your daily coding tasks so much easier, to the powerful URL routing and dynamic LINQ queries that allow you to generate entire web applications from a data model." Speaker="Oleg Sych" />
        <Session Id="110" Name="Chat Application Using Push Notification with Windows Phone 7" Track="Services and More" StartTime="14:10:00" EndTime="15:10:00" Level="200" Room="V101" Description="Come and learn all about Push Notifications. The basics, the different types, the architecture, and how to send notifications. We will close the session by demoing push notifications using a chat application." Speaker="Jonas Stawski" />
        <Session Id="88" Name="RAD Development in VS2010 using EF4 with WCF Data Services and SL4" Track="Services and More" StartTime="09:40:00" EndTime="10:40:00" Level="200" Room="V101" Description="This talk will focus on rapid application development using Entity Framework 4 with WCF Data Services and Silverlight 4 in Visual Studio 2010. There are a number of new features in both EF4 and WCF4 which enable more powerful data binding scenarios in distributed applications, and those enhancements will be highlighted. WCF Data Services exposes your data via the OData protocol, which allows many kinds of client applications to easily consume it, as it's essentially a RESTful, Atom publication format. This is a code-heavy session with minimal slides, and is very compelling if you're building Line of Business or other data-centric applications." Speaker="Stan Schultes" />
