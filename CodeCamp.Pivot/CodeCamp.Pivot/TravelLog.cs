    /// control, so that hitting the "Back" button will take you back to previous ViewerStates (and will also take you
    /// back to the current item, if there was one when you last left that ViewerState). The feature works through two
    /// event handlers, one hooked to the PivotViewer, and one hooked to the browser:
    //
    /// 1) Handle an event from the PivotViewer indicating that the ViewerState has changed by creating unique
    ///    navigation states and mapping them to the ViewerStates (ViewerState changes as a result of applying
    ///    filters, changing the view, changing the sort order, etc)
    /// 2) Handle a navigation state change by finding the mapped ViewerState and applying it
    ///    back to the PivotViewer control
    //
    /// Because changing the ViewerState can cause a navigation state change, and changing the navigation state
    /// can cause a ViewerState change, flags indicating that a navigate is in progress are necessary to prevent
    /// an infinite loop.
    //
    /// Note that this sample travel log implementation does NOT survive the Silverlight app getting unloaded. When the
    /// app is unloaded, the navigation state-to-ViewerState mappings are not persisted to any sort of storage, and so
    /// they are lost. Thus, after that navigating forward or back will not take you to the correct states.
